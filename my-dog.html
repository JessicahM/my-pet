    <h1>My Dog:)</h1>
    <img src="img/german-shepherd-cute-dog.jpg" alt="photo of scott.">
    <p>My dog is called <em>scott</em> inspired by the main character in the tv series <em>Teenwolf</em> . Scott is a long and short coat hybrid <strong> German shepherd </strong> . He is a fearless and protective friend who has been with me since he was a puppy. Scott is playful and can be very goofy at times.</p><p> As a German, he has lots of <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/characteristics/energy-level">energy</a> and requires daily walks. Skipping his walks isn't much of an option because he always finds a way to make a spectacle out of it, which is never  pretty. I end up having torn dirty clothes all over. Worst thing is i never manage to stay mad at him for long, which i don't mind in the least. He makes my cat miserable but im tryin to make bestfriends out of them which is proving to be harder than i thought:(. I'm not giving up:)!!</p>
    <p>The neighbourhood dogs don't have a chance, because my dig id the alpha;).</p>

    <p>My mission at the moment is to make him fat!!!</p>
