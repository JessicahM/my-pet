    <h1>My Dog:)</h1>
    <img src="img/german-shepherd-cute-dog.jpg" alt="photo of scott.">
    <p>My dog is called <em>scott</em> inspired by the main character in the tv series <em>Teenwolf</em> . Scott is a long and short coat hybrid <strong> German shepherd </strong> . He is a fearless and protective friend who has been with me since he was a puppy. Scott is playful and can be very goofy at times.</p><p> As a German, he has lots of <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/characteristics/energy-level">energy</a> and requires daily walks. Skipping his walks isn't much of an option because he always finds a way to make a spectacle out of it, which is never  pretty. I end up having torn dirty clothes all over. Worst thing is i never manage to stay mad at him for long, which i don't mind in the least. He makes my cat miserable but im tryin to make bestfriends out of them which is proving to be harder than i thought:(. I'm not giving up:)!!</p>
    <p>The neighbourhood dogs don't have a chance, because my dig id the alpha;).</p>

    <p>My mission at the moment is to make him fat!!!</p>

    <h3>History of German Shepherds</h3>

    <p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ebfnO3nA_qU/maxresdefault.jpg">The German Shepherd breed appeared late at the end of the <em>19th century</em> in Germany and they were first exhibited at a show in Hanover in 1882. They were not like German Shepherds as we know them today though being rough coated, short tailed and rather resembling mongrels. The German Shepherd Dog as we now know it didn't really appear until after the <strong>Second World War</strong>. The breed was actually created by the cross breeding of working sheep dogs from rural Germany by an ex cavalry officer called <em>Max von Stephanitz</em> whose aim was to create a working dog for herding which could trot for long periods. A breed standard was drawn up and the first breed show took place in 1899 following which the GSD became firmly established across Germany. In 1906 the first dogs were exported to the USA . Since then, the breed has grown enormously in popularity and is now one of the most popular <strong>pedigree breeds</strong> in the UK as a pet as well as being the favourite working breed for many forces, especially the police. They are widely used for security purposes because of their strong protective instincts.</p>
